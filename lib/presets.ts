    q: "Can I use the videos commercially — for my shop or ads?",
    a: "Paid plans include commercial use, so you can run reviewed clips on your Etsy, TikTok Shop, Amazon, or paid ads. The single Free Mini live trial is for personal use and shows an on-player mark.",
  },
  {
    q: "How many photos do I need?",
    a: "Just one. A single clear photo of the toy you own is enough — no multi-angle shoot, no turntable, no rig.",
  },
  {
    q: "How is this different from just filming with my phone?",
    a: "Filming gives you direct control over the real object; Pikbo offers generated motion and scenes from one photo. Outputs can change small sculpt or color details, and configured live renders usually take 30–90 seconds."
