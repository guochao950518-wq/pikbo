# Handoff log — quality work others should reuse

Newest first. One block per meaningful landing.

---

### 2026-07-23 — [grok] Phase F mobile Create/Seller sticky craft
- Create 390px sticky: ownership checkbox + photo scroll target; launch-8 chips + More recipes on mobile.
- Result metadata shows Settlement + Download policy.
- Seller Pack/Batch sticky mobile CTA (ownership + run); desktop primary hidden on small screens.
- Batch children store requestId and open via `/api/downloads` when allowed.
- Verified: typecheck · engine-smoke. Next: performance/proof labels or remaining polish.

### 2026-07-23 — [grok] Library Free-download honesty + local job retry
- Library blocks Free live raw Open/Download/Copy (T6 parity with Create); uses `/api/downloads/[requestId]` when present.
- `historyItemDownloadAllowed` shared policy in `lib/history.ts`.
- `POST /api/generations/[id]/retry` forks local queued child via `forkRetryJob` (202) — not 501; client still re-POSTs generate with photo.
- Create Download prefers controlled download endpoint when version has requestId.
- Verified: engine-smoke · lint · typecheck. No fal spend this cycle.

### 2026-07-23 — [grok] Phase H SEO: no thin index pages / noindex private
- `lib/seoIndex.ts`: `recipeHasUniqueProof` from DEMO_VIDEOS; concept/private/preview robots.
- Effects without unique Lab sample → `noindex,follow` + chip; LandingResults no shared-loop fake proof.
- Tools/for/toys noindex when primary recipe lacks unique proof; sitemap omits those + preview doors.
- robots disallow cinema/image/apps/models/flow/supercomputer/generate; apps/models/flow/batch noindex.
- Verified: engine-smoke · typecheck. Next: Phase F Create mobile polish or retry local job.

### 2026-07-23 — [grok] Phase D local job ledger + download gate + demo critical-path
- In-process `lib/generationJobs` records sync generate success/fail (idempotency + ownership).
- `GET/POST /api/generations` + `GET /api/generations/[id]` return real local jobs (no longer 501).
- `GET /api/downloads/[id]` → 403 Free live raw (`DOWNLOAD_BLOCKED`); demo/paid redirect.
- Health `acceptance.demoCached|softLive|paid`; critical-path defaults demo (strict: `REQUIRE_SOFT_LIVE=1`).
- Verified: engine-smoke · lint · typecheck. Not multi-node durable — Supabase still required. T6 bake blocked.

### 2026-07-23 — [grok] continuous: Seller Pack export + Library honesty + retry stub
- `lib/sellerPackExport.ts`: CSV/manifest only for succeeded+downloadable children; no fake ZIP.
- BatchStudio Export CSV / Manifest; Library title says **Saved on this device**.
- `POST /api/generations/[id]/retry` → 501 honest. Home CTAs fire analytics no-ops.

### 2026-07-23 — [grok] continuous: Phase D stubs + Create analytics hooks
- `POST /api/assets/upload-url` and `POST /api/webhooks/video-provider` → honest 501.
- Create `track(generate_start|generate_result)` no-ops unless `NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_URL`.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` still **cannot push** (OAuth lacks `workflow` scope) — template remains `docs/ci/`.

### 2026-07-23 — [grok] continuous: fonts offline, Create launch-8, analytics stub
- Removed next/font/google (CI/offline builds no longer need fonts.googleapis.com).
- Create shows 8 launch recipes first + “More recipes” expand.
- Optional `lib/analytics.ts` no-op without NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_URL.
- robots disallow `/login`; More menu → Sign in; CI template adds prod link-check.
- G6 harness notes: `scripts/g6-harness.md`.

### 2026-07-23 — [grok] Auth shell + durable shadow + Phase D stubs
- `/login` honest gate: no fake form when Supabase keys missing; form shell when configured.
- `GET /api/auth/status` public readiness (no secrets).
- Generate live path optional **shadow** reserve/settle/release when `DURABLE_CREDITS=local|1` (Cookie still authoritative).
- Phase D stubs: `GET/POST /api/generations` + `GET /api/generations/[id]` return 501 with compatibility notes.
- Profile links to sign-in status.

### 2026-07-23 — [grok] Phase C start — T5 durable credits foundation
- SQL: `supabase/migrations/20260723120000_t5_auth_credits.sql` (wallets, ledger, reservations, jobs, guest migration, RLS read policies).
- Pure engine: `lib/durableCredits/engine.ts` reserve / settle / release / guest migrate + idempotency.
- Local file adapter: `data/durable-credits.json` (dev); production still Cookie until Supabase env + REQUIRE gate.
- Health probes `durableCredits`; Create session stills interned via `sourceKey` (no 8× Base64).
- engine-smoke: concurrent 5/6 reserves, Seller Pack 30 partial settle/release, idempotent reserve.
- Boss blockers consolidated: `docs/BLOCKERS_REQUEST.md` (workflow scope, Supabase keys, FAL budget).
- Soft-launch generate path still Cookie-authoritative; durable path not forced until Supabase wired.

### 2026-07-23 — [grok] Wave B generation trust (B1–B6)
- Branch: `agent/grok/higgsfield-wave-b-trust` → main.
- **B1** `lastRequestCreditState` separate from version `creditState`; success→fail keeps `refund unconfirmed` / `10 restored` (not overwritten by Vn used/cached).
- **B2** Immutable `GenerationSpec` per success; **Retry · same settings** reuses spec; **Make variant · current settings** uses Composer; Seller Pack `retryJob` still maps by slug only.
- **B3** `/api/generate` success echoes `effect`, `costCredits`, `creditsOutcome`; Create only labels server echo when present.
- **B4** Free live (`!demo && watermark`) Download disabled + reason; Batch same gate. **T6 remains blocked** (no ffmpeg bake).
- **B5** Explore `AutoPlayVideo focusable={false}` so Link is sole focus target.
- **B6** CI workflow authored at `docs/ci/github-actions-ci.yml` (conflict markers, engine-smoke, lint, typecheck, build). **Blocked pushing to `.github/workflows/`** — OAuth token has no `workflow` scope; boss should copy file with a token that has workflow scope.
- Pure helpers: `lib/createTrust.ts`. Regressions in `scripts/engine-smoke.mjs`.
- Verified: `npm run engine-smoke` · lint · typecheck · `npm run build` PASS.
- **Not done:** live G6×2, first GitHub Actions green URL (needs `.github` install), server watermark bake (T6), public launch still NO-GO.
- Next per `docs/GROK_FINAL_TAKEOVER.md`: durable auth/credits → async jobs → T6 bake → product finish.

### 2026-07-23 — [gpt] all remaining work reassigned to Grok
- Boss assigned Grok as the sole temporary implementation owner while Claude is unavailable and GPT quota is low.
- Canonical runbook: `docs/GROK_FINAL_TAKEOVER.md`; branch: `agent/grok/final-takeover`.
- Order: Wave B trust → CI → durable auth/credits → async jobs/assets → file watermark → product finish → proof/performance/SEO → Stripe test readiness → private RC.
- Grok must continue past external blockers and collect secrets, spend, login and DNS needs in one final `docs/BLOCKERS_REQUEST.md`.
- Live charging, paid model calls, public DNS and copied competitor content remain unauthorized without separate boss approval.

### 2026-07-23 — [gpt] Grok Wave B trust fixes dispatched
- Boss reassigned the next engineering pass to Grok on `agent/grok/higgsfield-wave-b-trust`.
- P0 order is frozen: settlement truth, Retry/Variant semantics, server metadata, free-download watermark gate, Explore focus, then visible CI.
- Existing successful versions and Seller Pack children must survive failed attempts; unknown refunds stay `refund unconfirmed`.
- Free live raw provider URLs cannot be downloadable; T6 stays blocked until the file itself is verified watermarked.
- Exact tests, forbidden scope, validation commands, and handoff evidence are in `docs/DISPATCH.md`; tracking row is `H-WAVE-B`.

### 2026-07-23 — [grok] Create version compare polish on Wave A
- Fast-forwarded `agent/grok/higgsfield-wave-a` onto main.
- Each success keeps source still + requestId/provider; switching versions restores Before still.
- Cap 8 session versions; creditState 0 cached / 10 used / 10 restored on fail.


### 2026-07-23 — [grok] Create version compare + server metadata polish
- Create session stack now stores source still / recipe / requestId / provider per version.
- Photo↔video compare uses the active version’s still (not the current compose upload).
- Result panel shows a server-metadata grid (recipe, model, duration, aspect, resolution, credits, task id).
- Failed regenerate keeps prior versions visible; stack capped at 8. Wave A code on main.

### 2026-07-23 — [grok] Higgsfield Wave A core loop ready for review
- Implementation SHA: `2e4a0a8` on `agent/grok/higgsfield-wave-a`.
- Scope: one canonical ShowcaseProject registry now drives Home, Explore, Inside Project, and recipe deep links; unknown project slugs return 404.
- Create keeps successful versions, labels cached/live and credit/refund state, and saves device-local project history without claiming cloud sync.
- Seller Pack canonical is `/create?mode=seller-pack`; its three fixed children settle independently, retain successes, and retry only failed items.
- Verification passed: engine-smoke, ESLint, TypeScript, production build, link-check, critical-path, and browser checks at 390/768/1440; public launch remains NO-GO.


### 2026-07-23 — [gpt] Wave A engineering reassigned to Grok
- Boss reassigned implementation because Claude is unavailable until Monday.
- Grok branch: `agent/grok/higgsfield-wave-a`; exact takeover block is in `docs/DISPATCH.md`.
- Order is fixed: ShowcaseProject → project detail → Home rail → Explore filters → Create versions → Library grouping → Seller Pack compatibility.
- Existing fal/API and Supabase product contracts remain authoritative; no second persistence layer or fake suite doors.
- Stripe, public DNS, copied Higgsfield content, and missing Audio/Canvas/MCP shells remain out of Wave A.

### 2026-07-23 — [gpt] Higgsfield full public-surface parity inventory
- `docs/prd/HIGGSFIELD_PUBLIC_PARITY.md` maps the inspected target's 17 top-level products plus presets, projects, assets, models, apps, profile, and settings.
- Wave A is the only immediate build: Home retention sequence, Explore, Create, Effects, Inside Project, Assets, and Seller Pack.
- Missing Image/Audio/Cinema/Canvas/Shorts/Explainer surfaces cannot enter primary navigation until they have a real provider-backed job.
- Exact target trademarks, copy, customer work, videos, lessons, and source code are excluded; PIKBO-owned replacements preserve the public interaction pattern.
- Claude owns Wave A engineering; Grok merges in the six-step order recorded in the parity contract.

### 2026-07-23 — [gpt] world-class contract final sync
- Seller Pack is canonical inside Create at `/create?mode=seller-pack`; `/supercomputer?pack=seller` remains a compatibility forward, not a primary product.
- Desktop and mobile navigation are frozen at five destinations; Generate is the only emphasized CTA.
- The Launch 12 now matches the boss-approved list, and homepage proof remains exactly eight distinct, traceable recipe assets.
- Official examples require five 1–5 review dimensions plus input, provider task ID, model, parameters, output, and reviewer notes.
- `SEO_INTENT_50.md` now has the exact 12 effect / 8 toy / 8 platform / 10 task / 6 problem / 6 role taxonomy; only ten proof-backed Wave 1 pages may ship.

### 2026-07-23 — [grok] G6 refund leg automation (dev/local)
- `PIKBO_FORCE_GENERATE_FAIL=1` on non-production generate: debit then `GENERATION_FAILED` + `creditsRefunded:true` (no fal burn).
- Verify: start `PIKBO_FORCE_GENERATE_FAIL=1 npm run dev`, then `G6_TEST_REFUND=1 npm run g6-api-smoke`.
- Still need: 2 more owned-toy **live** Mini successes for full G6 Pass (1 live already logged).
- Remix: Library history stores `sourceProject` + `channel` from Create remix handoff.


### 2026-07-23 — [grok] GPT research marked COMPLETE · shared hub
- GPT交付已在 main（含未推 origin 的 merge）：`WORLD_CLASS_PIKBO` · `SEO_INTENT_50` · `SOFT_NAV_AND_PRESETS` · **`RETENTION_REMIX_LOOP`**
- Notes: `docs/research/by-agent/GPT.md` → status ✅
- Consensus: `SHARED_SYNTHESIS` 增加 remake 闭环为 P0 抄项
- **Claude next:** implement `RETENTION_REMIX_LOOP.md`；填 `by-agent/CLAUDE.md` 实现矩阵
- Grok: push main to origin so all agents see GPT research

### 2026-07-23 — [gpt] home retention + official project Remix contract
- `RETENTION_REMIX_LOOP.md` converts live HF/Yiha inspection into a PIKBO-specific Toy Premiere → Before/After → recipe rail → Remix → Create loop.
- Current gap is explicit: `HfExploreHome` ignores projects, uses a low-opacity background, has no project detail, and loses context when the visitor leaves for Create.
- The contract freezes `ShowcaseProject`, validated `RemixIntent`, project detail fields, Create preflight, analytics events, performance limits, and 1440/768/390 acceptance.
- `WORLD_CLASS_PIKBO.md` now requires Home/Explore to preserve recipe context into the existing three-decision Create path.
- Claude handoff is in DISPATCH; no app/API/credits/Stripe/DNS implementation changed.

### 2026-07-23 — [grok] shared research hub for Grok+GPT+Claude
- Boss: all three agents research; results **in repo**; shared.
- Hub: `docs/research/README.md` · consensus `SHARED_SYNTHESIS.md` · notes `by-agent/{GROK,GPT,CLAUDE}.md`
- Paste tasks: `docs/PASTE_SHARED_RESEARCH.md`
- Merged onto main from GPT branch: `WORLD_CLASS_PIKBO.md`, `SEO_INTENT_50.md`, `SOFT_NAV_AND_PRESETS.md` (+ GO_NO_GO sync)
- Grok long-form remains: `COMPETITOR_PRODUCT_INTERACTION.md`
- **GPT/Claude:** pull main, fill your `by-agent/*.md`, push `[gpt]`/`[claude]`.


### 2026-07-23 — [gpt] world-class product contract + SEO Intent 50
- `WORLD_CLASS_PIKBO.md` freezes the four ICP paths, three-decision Create flow, Toy Identity assessment, SKU project model, Seller OS packs, state machine, and 12 launch recipes.
- Active prices remain unchanged; higher-ARPU tiers are research hypotheses gated by provider invoices, weighted credits, and paid pilots.
- `SEO_INTENT_50.md` maps 50 queries to canonical routes, recipes, internal links, capability gates, and thin-page protections.
- `SOFT_NAV_AND_PRESETS.md` freezes four primary nav routes, eight homepage proof slugs, route inventory, and the ten-step launch-day checklist.
- `GO_NO_GO.md` is formally product-complete but stays NO-GO until live/refund evidence and release checks pass.

### 2026-07-23 — [grok] G6 PARTIAL live path smoke (not full Pass)
- **1× live Mini OK:** POST `/api/generate` with `scout-still.webp` + `360-spin-showcase` + `ownsRights:true` → `demo:false`, fal `videoUrl`, credits **10→0**.
- **ownsRights gate OK:** without rights → **400**, credits unchanged (no false debit).
- **Still need for G6 Pass:** 2 more real owned-toy lives + 1 post-debit provider failure proving `creditsRefunded` (or HANDOFF notes from boss hand test).
- engine-smoke PASS · link-check PASS · main tip includes GPT seller-first copy + Lab unique demos.

### 2026-07-23 — [gpt] world-class seller copy + official proof + search intent
- Home now leads with “One toy photo. A clip ready to list or post.” and a seller/collector workflow instead of model-engineering language.
- Official examples, cached playback, and unverified concepts use distinct labels; Lab does not imply customer posts or engagement.
- Pricing frames finite output capacity and seller workload without promising sales; Free/Creator/Shop numbers remain on the active contract.
- Ten high-intent effect/use-case pages now use search-language H1s plus honest, page-specific FAQs; generated unseen angles require review.
- Technical SEO: buyer metadata, branded OG/X card, private-page noindex, stable sitemap dates, and `/create?effect=` canonical cleanup.

### 2026-07-23 — [claude] world-class Create + home proof wall (branch `agent/claude/world-class-create`)
- **Create flagship (390 mobile):** stepped Photo → Recipe → Generate → Result; sticky single primary CTA above bottom tab nav; demo/live/refund banner impossible to miss; advanced (model/duration/seed/prompt) collapsed; Text→Video / multi-model shelf off primary surface.
- **Home:** one ICP H1 + single CTA “Try free · Generate”; proof wall ≤8 unique Lab demos; multi-model theater / product shelf removed; thin Seller Pack entry only.
- **Seller Pack MVP:** `/supercomputer?pack=seller` freezes Listing Spin + Blind-box Reveal + Social Flash (1:1 / 9:16 / 9:16); Create links into pack; not full Seller OS (T5/atomic credits still TODO for GPT WORLD_CLASS PRD).
- **Perf:** kept `preload=metadata` + ≤2 concurrent autoplay.
- **Verified:** eslint changed files, `tsc --noEmit`, `next build` green (71 routes).
- **No Stripe / no fake multi-model / no extra top-nav.**

### 2026-07-23 — [grok] MOONSHOT world-class bar · $60k/day reverse plan
- Boss demand: world's best toy video site, Google traffic explosion, path to **$60k/day** sub revenue.
- Strategy: `docs/MOONSHOT_WORLD_CLASS.md` — unit-econ reverse, W1–W8 pillars, S0→S4 stages, kill HF shell theater.
- Dispatch: GPT `world-class-prd`, Codex `world-class-copy`, Claude `world-class-create` (spawned).
- Paste: `docs/PASTE_WORLD_CLASS.md`
- Honesty: $60k/day is **S4** (category leadership), not Sunday; build to that standard from S0.
- Public domain still GO-gated; quality bar upgraded from meh soft to W1–W5.

### 2026-07-23 — [claude] shell triage G1–G4/G7 soft (branch `agent/claude/shell-triage`)
- **G1 nav:** Primary = Explore · Create · Effects · Lab + Pricing/Generate CTAs. Models/Cinema/Batch/Feed/Image/Library under **More**. Mobile = Home · Effects · Generate · Lab · Pricing.
- **G2 density:** Homepage uses `buildHomeShowcaseFeed()` — max **8 unique** Lab demos; removed multi-pass shared-loop wall. Lab/Feed `buildVideoFeed()` no longer density-triplicates presets.
- **G4 404s:** `next.config.ts` permanent redirects for short/wrong `/for/*` slugs (e.g. `/for/etsy-sellers` → `/for/etsy-listing-videos`). Footer already uses real USE_CASES slugs.
- **Perf soft:** video `preload="metadata"` (no tile `preload=auto`); ≤2 concurrent autoplays in `AutoPlayVideo` + home `Clip`.
- **G7 topup:** `/api/dev/topup` forbidden on production (`NODE_ENV`/`VERCEL_ENV`); health `devTopup` matches.
- **Verified:** eslint changed files, `tsc --noEmit`, `next build` green (71 routes).
- **Remaining for GPT whitelist:** exact 8 preset slug list (`docs/prd/SOFT_NAV_AND_PRESETS.md`), formal G1/G2 Pass in GO_NO_GO; Codex honesty copy G3/G5; hand test G6.

### 2026-07-23 — [grok] merge shell-triage · G1/G2/G4/G7 soft yellow
- Merged `agent/claude/shell-triage` @ `fbe3bd6` → main (fast-forward).
- Homepage ≤8 unique demo feed; Lab showcase honesty partial; `/for/*` short slug redirects; video `preload=metadata` + concurrent play cap; prod topup hard-off.
- Earlier same day: soft primary nav + More; `creditsRefunded` client honesty (`237068e`/`7250d17`).
- **Still NO-GO public:** G3/G5 need Codex paste; G6 hand test; GPT formal whitelist PRD not pushed yet.
- Boss: paste `docs/PASTE_TO_GPT_CODEX_CLAUDE.md` ①② into GPT/Codex now.

### 2026-07-23 — [grok] NO-GO public launch · emergency dispatch GPT/Codex/Claude
- **Ruling:** Public `pikbo.ai` is **NO-GO** until G1–G7 green. Not a Stripe issue — empty nav, shared demo wall, footer 404s, unrun hand tests.
- Evidence: `docs/BRUTAL_EXPERT_ROAST_2026-07-23.md` · Gate: `docs/prd/GO_NO_GO.md` · Board: `docs/DISPATCH.md`
- **GPT NOW:** branch `agent/gpt/go-no-go-soft` → expand GO_NO_GO + `SOFT_NAV_AND_PRESETS.md` whitelist (paste block in DISPATCH).
- **Codex NOW:** branch `agent/gpt/shell-honesty-copy` → ICP/meta/Lab honesty (after or parallel safe strings).
- **Claude NOW:** branch `agent/claude/shell-triage` → cut nav, cap 8 presets, fix 404s, video preload.
- **Boss:** do **not** public-share domain until gate green; private `*.vercel.app` preview only if needed.
- Grok will merge triage + flip GO when evidence exists.

### 2026-07-23 — [gpt] Seller Pack + T5 durable-credit specifications (P4/P5)
- Paths: `docs/prd/SELLER_PACK.md` and `docs/prd/AUTH_CREDITS.md`; product/data specifications only.
- Seller Pack contract: one owned toy photo → Listing Spin, Blind-box Reveal, and Social Flash; cached preview costs 0, while three live children cost 30 credits at the current flat rate with no bundle discount.
- Failure rule: successful children remain deliverable; returned provider failures restore their own 10 credits; retry targets one failed child and never silently reruns a success.
- T5 contract: Supabase Auth + account membership + transactional wallet + append-only ledger + idempotent reserve/settle/release + durable Stripe event records.
- Priority: current 2–3 day soft-launch sprint remains first; Claude reviews these specs after soft launch and must not enable paid Seller Pack before the documented T5/Stripe gates.

### 2026-07-23 — [gpt] soft-launch product, credits, and Generate contracts (P1–P3)
- Paths: `docs/prd/SOFT_LAUNCH.md`, `docs/business/CREDITS_AND_PLANS.md`, and `docs/api/GENERATE.md`.
- Decision: invite-only cached/free Mini validation may proceed; real Stripe remains blocked until durable identity, transactional credits, idempotent billing, media protection, and operational gates pass.
- Pricing truth: Free 10 credits ≈ 1 Mini 5s 480p trial; Creator 50 ≈ 5; Shop 150 ≈ 15; cached demo playback costs 0 credits.
- API truth: current `/api/generate` is synchronous, Cookie-session based, flat 10 credits for live calls, refund-on-provider-failure, and returns a clearly distinguishable cached demo without `FAL_KEY`.
- Engineering handoff: Claude should implement only the documented soft-launch UI gaps after merge; no plan or endpoint semantics were changed in this docs-only delivery.

### 2026-07-23 — [gpt] wave2 Lab / Effects / empty-state honesty (T32)
- Paths: Community, Explore, Effects SEO/structured copy, Lab feed provenance, onboarding, trust, Library empty states, and homepage recipe CTAs.
- Provenance: cached media says Cached Lab; reused loops say Concept · shared loop; concept cards no longer read as Official UGC or offer a misleading Remake action.
- Free contract: one configured Seedance Mini 5s 480p live trial with an on-player mark; current flat allowances are approximately Free 1 / Creator 5 / Shop 15.
- Fallback: without provider access, Studio returns a labeled cached demo that does not animate the upload; effect reference clips are not claimed as exact preset outputs.
- Verified: full ESLint and TypeScript checks pass; no `app/api/**`, session, credits, Stripe, or layout/CSS changes.

### 2026-07-23 — [gpt] overnight cached/Lab/Mini truth pass (T31)
- Paths: Explore/navigation, PIKBO Lab cards, trust/empty states, preset/toy/use-case/guide copy, and truth-status docs.
- Labels: cached media is never called Live or Real; remix cards are Concept; the anonymous showcase is PIKBO Lab rather than a claimed user community.
- Free contract: one configured Seedance Mini 5s 480p trial with an on-player mark; without a provider, Studio uses a clearly labeled cached demo.
- Guardrails: removed exact-output, instant-speed, guaranteed-reach, and guaranteed-conversion claims; generated unseen angles and small details require review.
- Scope: presentation strings and content registries only; no API, session, credits, Stripe, layout, or CSS changes.

### 2026-07-23 — [gpt] truth-sync C1–C5
- Paths: pricing UI, CreateStudio/LandingToolPanel/Paywall/Profile/Credits copy, `README.md`, `docs/UNIT_ECONOMICS.md`, terms/preset FAQ, and audit docs.
- Contract: Free 10 credits ≈ one Mini 5s 480p live trial with an on-player mark; Creator 50 ≈ five; Shop 150 ≈ fifteen at the current flat 10-credit rate. No unlimited live generation claim remains.
- Demo truth: cached examples do not animate the upload or call the provider; cached homepage playback costs no credits, while Studio submissions follow the current API credit contract.
- Economics: current allowances are prototype estimates; 10s Standard Shop usage can still lose money, so weighted server metering, durable credits, and file-level watermarking remain launch gates.
- Verified: `eslint app components lib --max-warnings=0` and `git diff --check` pass. No `app/api/**`, session, credits, contracts, models, Stripe, or homepage-shell logic was changed.

### 2026-07-23 — [gpt] pricing UI aligned to the active credit contract (T30)
- Paths: `app/pricing/page.tsx`, `components/PricingPlanCards.tsx`, `components/PricingUsageEstimator.tsx`.
- Truth rule: Free 1 / Creator ~5 / Shop ~15 are the current server-backed flat-rate allowances, not stale prototype placeholders.
- Guardrail: billing remains gated, no unlimited claim is introduced, and future model/resolution/duration weighting is labeled as the next contract change.
- Reuse: pricing UI should derive quantities from `PLANS`, `CREDITS_PER_VIDEO`, and `clipsFromCredits` instead of inventing copy-only totals.
- Merged to main by Grok (PR #12).

### 2026-07-23 — [grok] Codex dispatched: truth-sync C1–C5
- Paths: `docs/DISPATCH.md`, `docs/GPT.md`, `docs/STATUS.md`
- Codex lane: conversion + pricing honesty; no API/session ownership.

### 2026-07-23 — [gpt] pricing messages + 390px first-screen pass (C4–C5 / T28–T29)
- Paths: `components/PricingHeroCopy.tsx`, pricing page/components, `HeroVideoBanner`, and `MobileGenerateBar`.
- Reuse: default pricing message is outcome-led; `/pricing?copy=cost` selects the cost-control variant via `data-pricing-copy-variant`.
- Truth rule (superseded by C1–C5): the current UI now follows the active flat-rate 1 / 5 / 15 allowance contract; billing remains gated.
- Mobile: 390×844 has no horizontal overflow, keeps both hero CTAs visible, and no longer overlays a duplicate floating CTA on Home.
- Verified: all-app ESLint, TypeScript + 69-route production build, both pricing variants, demo switch, and 390px browser geometry.

### 2026-07-23 — [gpt] conversion truth + unit economics (C3 / T26)
- Paths: `docs/UNIT_ECONOMICS.md`
- Decision (superseded by C1–C5): the implemented Free path is now one 5s Seedance Mini 480p trial with an on-player mark.
- Economics: Creator `$19` supports about five 5s Fast 720p or four 5s Standard 720p clips, not 50, at the reviewed fal rates.
- Reuse: charge credits by model + resolution + duration; **Grok implements** server-side ledger (not UI-only).
- Verified: sources linked in doc; arithmetic sensitivity included.

### 2026-07-23 — [claude] copy-seo-v2: taglines + shared objection FAQ (L1/L2)
- Paths: `lib/presets.ts` (all 22 taglines rewritten collector/seller-voiced; new `COMMON_FAQ` export), `app/effects/[slug]/page.tsx` (append `COMMON_FAQ` to render + FAQ JSON-LD).
- Reuse: import `COMMON_FAQ` and spread after page-specific FAQ on any tool landing.
- Pitfall: keep `COMMON_FAQ` generic; don't duplicate preset-local FAQ questions.
- Did NOT touch CreateStudio / generate API.

### 2026-07-23 — [gpt] promise-consistency audit (labels + overclaim sweep)
- Paths: `app/page.tsx`, `app/explore`, `app/community`, `app/apps`, `app/models`, `app/pricing`, `components/HeroVideoBanner.tsx`, `components/SeedanceCampaign.tsx`, `components/PresetPreviewCard.tsx`, `lib/videoFeed.ts`, `lib/site.ts`
- Why good: separates cached Lab examples, shared loops, concept recipes, configured workspaces, and live generation proof.
- Reuse / pitfalls:
  - `live` = implemented workspace, not proof FAL_KEY exists; UI may say `Configured`/`Wired`.
  - Presets without exact DemoVideo match: `Concept · shared loop`.
  - Community = PIKBO Lab until real accounts; no fictional authors.
  - `StatusBadge` is runtime live vs demo source.
- Merged to main by Grok 2026-07-23.

### 2026-07-23 — [grok] three-agent max push + CI + generate honesty
- Paths: `docs/DISPATCH.md`, `docs/STATUS.md`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `components/CreateStudio.tsx`
- Why: boss wants Grok+Codex+Claude at full capacity; shared board is the coordination channel.
- Reuse:
  - Codex: only DISPATCH C1–C5; branch `agent/gpt/convert-truth`
  - Claude: only DISPATCH L1–L4; branch `agent/claude/copy-seo-v2`
  - Do not invent fake community clips; Official/Cached labels stay.
  - Generate result strip explains demo vs live and refund-on-fail.
- CI: push/PR runs lint + build + conflict-marker scan.

### 2026-07-22 — [gpt] pricing conversion + usage estimator (T21)
- Paths: `app/pricing/page.tsx`, `components/PricingUsageEstimator.tsx`
- Why good: turns a static three-card page into a transparent monthly-output calculator, recommendation flow, plan comparison table, and clear FAQ while preserving the real checkout buttons.
- Reuse / pitfalls:
  - Historical note: the old 3 / 50 / 150 clip allowances are retired; C1–C5 aligns the UI to current ~1 / ~5 / ~15 output at `CREDITS_PER_VIDEO = 10`.
  - The calculator is illustrative of included credits, not a quote for model overages; keep wording tied to the current credit estimate.
  - No annual toggle or unlimited claim exists because neither billing mode is implemented.
  - Checkout stays in `PricingCheckoutButton`; do not duplicate Stripe logic inside the estimator.
- Verified: production build; desktop and 390px visual passes; quick choices switch Creator → Shop correctly; no browser warnings/errors.
- Depends on: `PLANS`, `CREDITS_PER_VIDEO`, existing Stripe checkout component. No checkout API, credits, session, entitlement, or webhook code changed.

### 2026-07-22 — [gpt] live model shelf + demo-aware preset wall (T12)
- Paths: `app/page.tsx`, `components/HomeModelShelf.tsx`, `components/PresetPreviewCard.tsx`, `components/PresetsWall.tsx`
- Why good: live Seedance cards use cached toy footage on hover/focus, while Kling/Veo stay visibly marked `Roadmap`; six presets with matching T2 assets show real video/posters and all remaining presets stay honest `Recipe` cards.
- Reuse / pitfalls:
  - `MODEL_DEMOS` is presentation-only. Cached previews do not prove which provider rendered them and must retain the `Cached preview` badge.
  - Preset video matching is by `DemoVideo.preset`; adding a verified demo automatically upgrades that recipe card without changing the wall.
  - Touch layouts intentionally keep posters still; the immersive T2 showcase remains the single autoplay surface on mobile.
  - Do not mark a roadmap model live until its generate route/provider capability is wired.
- Verified: production build; desktop and 390px model/preset visual passes; no browser warnings/errors.
- Depends on: T2 `DemoVideo` registry, shared `MODELS` catalog, Claude `PresetsWall`. No generation, credits, history, batch, session, or billing code changed.

### 2026-07-22 — [gpt] toy-first homepage demo theatre (T2)
- Paths: `app/page.tsx`, `components/HomeDemoShowcase.tsx`, `lib/demoVideos.ts`, `public/demos/`
- Why good: replaces the model-name-only hero with a real encoded before/after stage and six playable toy clips while preserving the shared AppShell, Apps, Models, Cinema, Supercomputer, PresetsWall, community, Library, and billing paths. Copy stays vertical to owned-toy photos and makes Free watermark, trial allowance, and subscription expansion explicit.
- Reuse / pitfalls:
  - Demo assets are cached original PIKBO prototype footage, so playback never calls fal or spends credits. Do not relabel them as newly generated model output.
  - `DemoVideo` IDs and `/create?effect=...` deep links are the stable contract; verified fal renders can replace the files later without rebuilding the component.
  - Hero preloads one clip; gallery clips use posters plus viewport/hover playback, pause off-screen, and honor reduced-motion preferences.
  - Keep both MP4 and WebM plus a poster for every replacement clip.
- Verified: production build; 1440px and 390px browser passes; Studio deep-link selects `Floating Hero`; no browser warnings/errors.
- Depends on: latest shared AppShell/catalog home, existing preset slugs, and Create Studio query-param selection. No credits, session, generate API, history, or billing code changed.

### 2026-07-22 — [claude] +4 viral presets (density)
- Paths: `lib/presets.ts` (+smoke-burst-entrance, +paint-splash, +power-aura, +hologram-glitch)
- Why good: 4 distinct high-impact viral effects for the presets wall / clone density; each is a studio effect AND SEO page (full fields + promptTemplate). No IP/brand, no human-hand generation. Now 22 effects.
- Reuse / pitfalls: data-only → auto pages+sitemap+wall+footer; keep prompts on the user's own figure; quality-first, avoid thin duplicates.

### 2026-07-22 — [grok] Library history + denser HF-class home
- Paths: `lib/history.ts`, `components/LibraryGrid.tsx`, `CreateStudio` pushHistory, `app/page.tsx` + PresetsWall, pricing app padding
- Why: generate → appears in Library (device-local); home matches model shelf + viral wall pattern
- Reuse: don't replace localStorage until Supabase; keep `pushHistory` on successful generate only

### 2026-07-22 — [grok] ByteDance Seedance as default video model
- Paths: `lib/models.ts`, `app/api/generate/route.ts`, `.env.example`
- Why: boss wants 字节模型出片. Current defaults are Seedance 2.0 full (paid) + Mini 480p (Free) on fal.
- Reuse: change models only via `FAL_MODEL` / `FAL_MODEL_FREE`; keep input `prompt` + `image_url` + duration/aspect/resolution.
- Cost: Seedance is not free — always meter credits; Free uses Mini + 480p and the current 10-credit trial contract.

### 2026-07-22 — [grok] Stripe billing + entitlements (T4)
- Paths: `lib/entitlements.ts`, `lib/stripe.ts`, `lib/session.ts` (merge), `app/api/webhooks/stripe`, `app/api/checkout`, `app/api/checkout/confirm`, CreateStudio confirm on return, `/privacy` `/terms`, homepage pipeline demo
- Why good: real subscription path without Supabase yet. Webhooks update durable plan; browser confirm upgrades cookie; credits not clobbered on every request (periodKey reset only).
- Reuse / pitfalls:
  - Set `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_PRICE_*`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
  - Webhook URL: `/api/webhooks/stripe`
  - Entitlements file default `data/entitlements.json` (gitignored); serverless should move to Redis/Supabase (T5)
  - Never overwrite cookie credits from entitlement unless `periodKey` changes or free→paid upgrade
- Depends on: existing pricing plans + cookie session

### 2026-07-22 — [claude] guides / informational content axis (T11)
- Paths: `lib/guides.ts` (3 articles), `app/guides/page.tsx` (index), `app/guides/[slug]/page.tsx` (article + Article/FAQ JSON-LD), `app/sitemap.ts` (+guides), `components/Footer.tsx` (+Guides link)
- Why good: adds a 4th, top-of-funnel keyword axis (informational how-to / tips / ideas) that funnels readers into /create + related effects. Data-driven — add a `Guide` object to get a new page + sitemap entry. Build green (52 static pages).
- Reuse / pitfalls: keep `relatedEffects` to valid preset slugs; write genuinely useful prose (no thin filler) or it won't rank; guides link out to effects to spread internal-link equity. Footer Guides link makes them crawlable from every page.
- Depends on: `getPreset` + `PresetCard`.

### 2026-07-22 — [claude] effect preset expansion (T9)
- Paths: `lib/presets.ts` (+assemble-reveal, +paparazzi-flash, +kaiju-rampage); internal-link rewire in `lib/toytypes.ts` (model-kits, action-figures) + `lib/usecases.ts` (instagram)
- Why good: 3 distinct high-intent viral/scene effects, each a studio effect **and** full SEO landing page (h1/title/description/faq/promptTemplate). Quality over quantity — no keyword padding. Cross-linked from relevant toy-type/use-case pages so new effects get inbound internal links.
- Reuse / pitfalls: a new preset needs a valid `category` (showcase/unboxing/comealive/scene) so the hub + homepage group it; keep `promptTemplate` emphasizing the user's real figure (no brand replication). Append order doesn't matter — pages group by category.
- Depends on: `/effects/[slug]` route + `presetsByCategory`.

### 2026-07-22 — [claude] long-tail SEO expansion (T3)
- Paths: `lib/usecases.ts` (+whatnot-live-selling, +depop-shop-videos), `lib/toytypes.ts` (+vinyl-figures, +resin-sofubi, +model-kits)
- Why good: extends the Use-case + Toy-type axes into distinct long-tail intents (live-selling / resale platforms; vinyl / sofubi / gunpla subcultures) picked from competitor-page keyword research. Data-only change → auto-generates pages + sitemap + footer.
- Reuse / pitfalls: to add a page, append one object to the array — page, sitemap, footer come free. Keep each entry's `recommendedEffects` to valid preset slugs (cross-link mesh). Keep prompts/content genuinely distinct to avoid thin-content; don't add brand-name (trademark) slugs.
- Depends on: existing `/for/[slug]` and `/toys/[slug]` route components.

### 2026-07-22 — [grok] collab protocol
- Paths: `COLLAB.md`, `docs/STATUS.md`, `docs/HANDOFF.md`, `AGENTS.md`
- Why: three agents can sync via GitHub without thrashing
- Reuse: always `git pull` + read STATUS before coding

### 2026-07-22 — [grok] guest credits + checkout scaffolding
- Paths: `lib/session.ts`, `lib/credits.ts`, `lib/pricing.ts`, `app/api/me`, `app/api/generate`, `app/api/checkout`, `app/pricing`, `components/CreateStudio.tsx`
- Why good: no DB required; 402 when out of credits; free watermark flag; Stripe-ready; dev upgrade without keys
- Reuse rules:
  - Deduct credits **before** fal call; **refund** on failure
  - Free plan → `watermark: true`; paid → false
  - Keep `CREDITS_PER_VIDEO = 10` unless pricing doc updates
  - Demo mode (no `FAL_KEY`) is **free** (0 credits) — labeled cached Lab only; live path deducts before fal and refunds on failure

### 2026-07-22 — [mixed] 3-axis pSEO
- Paths: `lib/presets.ts`, `lib/usecases.ts`, `lib/toytypes.ts` + `app/effects|for|toys`
- Why good: effects × seller use-cases × toy types internal link mesh
- Reuse: new preset = studio effect **and** SEO page fields; cross-link from usecases
